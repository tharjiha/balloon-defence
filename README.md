## 🕹️ Game Concept

In traditional tower defense games, enemies try to cross the map, and the player sets up defensive units to stop them. **Balloon Defense** adds a unique twist:

- 🧨 **Enemies**: Pins attempting to pop the player's balloon.
- 🎯 **Objective**: Defend the big balloon at the end of the path by preventing too many pins from reaching it.
- 🏹 **Defense**: Place and upgrade robots to knock back or eliminate pins.

## 💡 Gameplay Features

- 🎈 The balloon has a set amount of lives. If too many pins reach it, the balloon pops and the game ends.
- 💰 Players start with limited coins to buy two basic catapults.
- 💸 Earn coins by successfully stopping pins.
- ⬆️ Use coins to **upgrade** or **replace** robots with more powerful ones.
- 📈 The strength of pins increases over time, requiring strategic upgrades.
- 🎯 Goal: Survive as long as possible and earn the highest score before the balloon bursts.
